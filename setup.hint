ldesc: "Kwave is a sound editor designed for the KDE Desktop 
Environment. With Kwave you can edit many sorts of wav-files including 
multi-channel files. You are able to alter and play back each channel on 
its own. Kwave also includes many plugins (most are still under 
development) to transform the wave-file in several ways and presents a 
graphical view with a complete zoom- and scroll capability."
